1.) 9 different data types
2.) Integery, Float, Complex, String, List, Dictionary, Tuple, Boolean, and NoneType
3.) b-m, d-l, e-h-k
4.) l is not an integer because the str() command converts whatever is in the () to a string
5.) Another data type is a set, which is used to store multiple items in a single variable, and it is
a collection that is unordered, unindexed, and you cannot change set items, but you can add and remove set items
